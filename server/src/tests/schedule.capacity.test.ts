/**
 * Manual Test Plan for Capacity Counts during Booking and Cancellation
 * 
 * This file documents manual test cases since automated unit testing for the capacity
 * count feature is challenging due to dependencies and mocking complexities.
 *
 * TEST CASE 1: Verify capacity count decreases when booking a time slot
 * 1. Sign in as a user
 * 2. Navigate to the schedule page
 * 3. Find a class with available capacity (e.g., 5/8)
 * 4. Book the class
 * 5. Verify the capacity count decreased by 1 (e.g., now shows 6/8)
 * 6. Check the server logs to confirm the update was successful
 *
 * TEST CASE 2: Verify capacity count increases when cancelling a booking
 * 1. Sign in as a user who already has a booking
 * 2. Navigate to the schedule page
 * 3. Find the class with your booking
 * 4. Cancel the booking
 * 5. Verify the capacity count increased by 1 (e.g., from 6/8 to 5/8)
 * 6. Check the server logs to confirm the update was successful
 *
 * TEST CASE 3: Verify capacity count cannot exceed the maximum capacity of 8
 * 1. Set up a class with max capacity (8/8 participants)
 * 2. Have a user cancel their booking
 * 3. Verify the capacity count shows 7/8
 * 4. Make another booking
 * 5. Verify the capacity returns to 8/8
 *
 * TEST CASE 4: Verify user cannot book a class at full capacity
 * 1. Find a class with 8/8 capacity
 * 2. Try to book the class
 * 3. Verify booking is not allowed and error message appears
 *
 * TESTING NOTES:
 * - The implementation in schedule.controller.ts already handles incrementing
 *   and decrementing capacity correctly
 * - The cancel booking function prevents currentParticipants from going below 0
 * - The booking function prevents booking when currentParticipants >= capacity
 * - The client UI disables the book button when a class is full
